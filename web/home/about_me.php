   <h1>About Me</h1>
   <p>
       Hello, my name is Zach and I'm a Computer Science major.
       I'm interested in Machine Learning and would like to go
       to grad school some day, but that looks like it might be
       far ahead of me for now. I currently intern at a startup
       company in Seattle called MultiScale Health Networks. If
       you want to find out more about what they do, just go to
       their <a href="https://multiscale.io/">website</a>. <br>
       I served a mission in the Texas Houston South Mission
       from 2012-2014 (I'm old). I started going to school at
       BYU Idaho in Spring of 2015 where I decided to major in
       Computer Science and I've stuck with it ever since.
   </p>
